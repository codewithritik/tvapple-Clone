myproject
Hello Reader, I’m here to share my and my group’s experience of building our first website i.e. “ Apple TV+”. This project was quite difficult for my team as a first project we all are studying in Masai School and currently, we are at the end of the second unit we all have a week to create the “Apple TV+” website.
Name of members in the group (Apple TV+)
Ritik Gupta
Riyaz Ahmad
Vishesh Kushwaha
Aman Katiyar
Aditya Verma
Anupama Kumari
Real apple tv website link.
Apple TV+
All Apple Originals.
tv.apple.com

You can visit that link which is given above, “Apple TV+” website for original References of website, we start working on this project in the evening of that Monday and we put all our effort for continuous 7 days because today is Sunday and we did final work for today as I’m writing a blog in the medium so it means we all just roll up all project works just before this. None of all members is from a computer background but everyone put their 100% in the project so that’s why we all can make such an exact clone of the “apple TV+” website as we all know that apple’s all websites are always so good and difficult to create as well.
Steps for creating that website
Task distribution
On the very first day of our construct week, we just discuss personal things to know each other because if we don’t know our partners so then it is supposed that we can’t do work together every person in my group is so nice, then after knowing to each one we come to the task distribution we just know every person’s strong area and assigned the related work to them this technique makes our work smooth.

Work and problem solving
When anyone of us got stuck anywhere in process of creating a website we get help from each other this thing is very helpful to all of us. Some of the members are good the at logic part and some of them are good at HTML and CSS.
we also use GitHub workspace for our project and for everyone this GitHub is New I find that it is difficult to use but we all spend some time on GitHub so eventually we all get the idea to use GitHub.
Technology Stack Used
HTML
CSS
JavaScript

Finalization & Marge
when the time came we all are ready with our final pages and now our next step is to marge all files and pulls them to the main branch of GitHub in the beginning of this process we all get trouble, but after too many attempts we get the way to do so than finally, we got our ultimate output and page looks a user flow is as same as original “Apple TV+” website.
here is a snap for our cloned website — :

Concepts we covered in the entire unit:
HTML
CSS
DOM
Media query
GitHub
we covered all the concepts in our group project which is given above, Masai school taught these things very nicely. but sometimes we all got stuck at a point because there are lots of things on this website which we are not learned till now but we have to use the things, so we use to search in google to find a suitable solution.
here are some websites which are prefered by group:-
https://flickity.metafizzy.co/
https://www.w3schools.com/
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/
https://codepen.io/pen/
Ending note and takeaways
As mentioned earlier, we were able to attain the required layout because of the communication that we maintained. The command chain that we follow and the level of understanding about the topic we had. I felt proud to work with such
